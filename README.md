# AsciiImage

This is a program that will convert normal png files into their ascii counterparts. You can then export this into a text file or another png. To first run the application either use the shell or batch script at the top of the zip file. All you gotta do is select a png image and then specify the amount of pixels per character and click ```Convert```.

You are able to pan and zoom around the photo as you would expect.

The ```Switch``` button is used to switch between the original image and the ascii one so it will be blank if you switch before converting.

The reason this project is special is I have created the PNG decoder/reader myself.

Currently probably doesn't work on mac or linux sorry, maybe later.
