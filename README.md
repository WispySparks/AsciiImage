# AsciiImage

This is a program that will convert normal png files into their ascii counterparts. You can then export this into a text file or another png. All you gotta do is select a png image and then specify the amount of pixels per character and click ```Convert```.

You are able to pan and zoom around the photo as you would expect.

The ```Switch``` button is used to switch between the original image and the ascii one so it will be blank if you switch before converting.

You can click on the ascii image because it looks better once you zoom in.
